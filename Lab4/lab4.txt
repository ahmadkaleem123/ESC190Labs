1. Write a header file for operating on linked lists (include at least inserting a value, deleting a node with a specified value (if there is more than one, delete the first one), and freeing the entire linked list). Write a file linkedlist.c that implements the functions declared in the h file. Now write a main file with a main function that uses the functions declared in the h file. Make sure that everything compiles and runs correctly.

2. In Python, write a function find(L, e) that takes in a sorted list L and an element e, and returns the lowest index in L such that L[i] == e. (-1 if there is no such ind*ex)
   Write a function that takes in a sorted linst L and an element e, and returns the index of the highest index in L such that L[i] == e. (-1 if there is no such index).
   The function should run in O(log(n)) time.
   This should help you with Project 1.
